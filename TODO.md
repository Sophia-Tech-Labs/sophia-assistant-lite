Add public and private mode to sophia assistant to make it easier for creating a group for it.. but that would have more complex logic for some commands...
Change the admin section into a saas project where u can buy admin code instead of getting for free then later we turn it into a full market where u can buy things.. things like data,airtime maybe even waec pins ðŸ˜‚ it would boost sophia's publicity

and also make a free version for web.. and don't forget to remember fine tuning..
